## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at School of Computing and Information, University of Pittsburgh, working under the mentorship of Dr. Na Du. Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my master's degree in Information Science from University of Pittsburgh and my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Sichuan University, China. My current research involves understanding human behavior changes during human-robot interaction, such as cooperation between human-driven vehicles and autonomous vehicles.

## Research Interests
